# About
This is a project of a geometric calculator, so you can input shapes and values and it will calculate unknown values.
It will have a GUI where you can insert these shapes, or use some kind of API to return the requested value.

# Contributing
- Any help with the project will be appreciated, as i'm making this without knowledge of some techniques.
- I request that you don't copy code from other projects and that you try to build the code yourself, as i'm not worried with any optimisations yet.
  - But if optimisation does become a problem for certain calculations, which i'm sure it will, mark it as non automatic in the code *(Which is not implemented yet)*.
